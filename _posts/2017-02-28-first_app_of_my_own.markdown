It's the end of the Object Orientation part of the course, it's almost 2 months since I started at Flatiron, and it's time to make my first real app happen! This is all part of the assignment called the "CLI Data Gem Project", but it's more than just an assignment. Up until now, every lab was a "pass the tests, move on" type of ordeal, sometimes easy, sometimes challenging, but always confined to a set of instructions and expectations. A great way to learn, but do I appreciate being thrown into water and told to swim as well - when the threat of drowning is real, one tends to seriously become better. And so, today, I've finalized the idea for this project, written down a ton of notes about what it will do, bootstrapped the project folder, set up a Git repo, written the first test, and made it pass. What I can say is, the whole thing up until now has been so exciting I actually felt the need to blog about it, which fact is utterly unusual because I've never seriously blogged and never seen myself doing it. Blogging was part of the assignment, but I'm happy to be doing it because I felt like it.

I've set two requirements for this project. First, it has to be something useful for me personally. Second, it has to be tested. Unit-tested, like. Maybe not a full-blown test suite that covers every single instance method, but enough to both develop my RSpec skills and be useful for the app's development. So, the app is going to be a scraper for New York's MTA Subway web page: nothing fancy, just service status for each subway line and details about service changes and planned work - because there's never a boring day on the NYC subway. As for writing tests... Well, test-driven development is a luxury for me so far, simply because I don't yet know enough RSpec - a shame, since every time I read RSpec code, I am completely floored by how incredibly clear, fast, and expressive it is, and I can say confidently that RSpec is one of my favourite things about programming in Ruby.

So, this is short, but I am thrilled to be writing this, and really excited to develop the app, run into problems, solve them, and share the frustration and eventual joy. Back here soon!
